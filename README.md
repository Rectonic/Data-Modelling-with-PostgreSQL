<p align="center"> A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. 
To complete the project, we will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You have to make sure that you installed PostgreSQL on your local computer and have a sample database to create a new one

Firstly, you have to install all packages in requirements.txt file wih a command


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running a project

We have all terminal commands written in a single sh script, so you will have to execute it in order to 


```
chmod +x etl.sh```
./etl.sh 

```
